# M.2 styled SSD earrings (yeah yeah they're SATA keyed I know)

I planned to make a larger version for something at some point, but don't remember what for.

m2small is the version I made and ordered for OSH Park After Dark.

m2small_mask is an untested version with the copper unmasked for non-clear soldermask. Might not be right though... Figured I would add it as on option though.
