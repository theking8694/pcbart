# PCB Art (and stuff)
Small place to put the more creative things I make using PCBs

These are small projects I decided to make for one reason or another, and sometimes to just test out things like PCB appearance.

I do plan to make something "functional" and wearable at some point, but I still need the ideal idea and the ideal parts.

Currently Available:
* m.2 SSD earrings (or keychain or whatever really)
